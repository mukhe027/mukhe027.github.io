In this project, we address the problem of collaborative tasks in a multi-robot system where
we investigate that how interactions within members of the multi-robot system can induce
instability. We conduct rigorous theoretical analysis and identify when the system will be
unstable and hence classify interactions that will lead to stable multi-robot coordination.
Our theoretical analysis tries to emulate realistic interactions in a multi-robot system such
as limited interactions (blind spots) that exists when on-board cameras are used to detect
and track other robots in the vicinity. So we study how these limited interactions induce
instability in the multi-robot system. To verify our theoretical analysis experimentally,
we developed a portable multi-robot testbed that enables us to test our theory on stable
coordination of multi-robot system with a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in both
indoor and outdoor settings. With this feature of the testbed we are able to investigate the
difference in the multi-robot system behavior when tested in controlled indoor environments
versus an uncontrolled outdoor environment. Ultimately, the motivation behind this project is
to emulate realistic conditions for multi-robot cooperation and investigate suitable conditions
for them to work in a stable and safe manner. Therefore, our contribution is two fold ; i) We
provide rigorous theoretical analysis that enables stable coordination of multi-robot systems
with limited interactions induced by sensor capabilities such as cameras; ii) We developed
a testbed that enables testing of our theoretical contribution with a team of real robots in
realistic environmental conditions.
